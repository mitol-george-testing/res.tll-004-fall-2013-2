Summary
-------

This video leads students through an approximation technique to compute the fuel efficiency of a car moving at highway speeds. This is accomplished by using dimensional analysis and a simple experiment to identify the exponents in a formula for the drag force on a car.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Model drag to predict terminal velocities.
*   Determine the fuel efficiency of a car.
