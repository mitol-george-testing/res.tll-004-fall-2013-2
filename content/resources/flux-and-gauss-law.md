Summary
-------

This video examines Gauss' Law and area integrals in detail, focusing on extracting as many variables as possible from the integral through careful choice of a Gaussian surface. Symmetry is defined and used extensively, and students have an opportunity to choose a surface that will maximize symmetry for a given situation. The video also includes a brief discussion of when approximations are appropriate, and finishes with MIT professors and postdoctoral students explaining how they think about flux.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Implement Gauss’ Law more effectively.
*   Give an organized view of electric flux.
*   Categorize situations by symmetry.
*   Learn how to choose a Gaussian surface.
