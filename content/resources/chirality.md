Summary
-------

In this video, students are introduced to the concept of chiral molecules and the relationship between molecular structure and function. Students first analyze some everyday objects and determine if they are chiral or achiral. Students then extend this idea to small molecules and proteins. Mirror image proteins are discussed, specifically antifreeze proteins.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Identify chiral objects and molecules.
*   Understand how chirality plays a role in the function of biological compounds.
