Summary
-------

Prof. Krystyn Van Vliet discusses the importance and utility of enzyme kinetics for drug development. Alongside the video, students derive a rate equation (the Michaelis-Menten equation) for a simple enzyme-substrate system. Returning to the drug development example, students see that rate equations can help them infer information about reaction mechanisms.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Explain how enzymes affect reaction rates.
*   Derive a rate law for a general enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
