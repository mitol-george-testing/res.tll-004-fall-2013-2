Summary
-------

This video uses a series of examples and student-active segments to investigate the concepts of torque and equilibrium. The primary context is balance in the human body. Students are involved in partner activities, brainstorms, and problem-solving segments as the video progresses.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Draw torque diagrams
*   Practice setting up torque problems
*   Determine whether someone can balance
