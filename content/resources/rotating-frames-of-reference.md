Summary
-------

This video leads students through descriptions of the motion of two objects observed from two frames of reference: a rotating turntable, and the relatively stationary ground frame. The centripetal and Coriolis accelerations that arise in rotating frames of reference are explored. Finally, we use the Coriolis effect to explain the rotational direction of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Explain why centripetal and Coriolis accelerations arise in rotating frames of reference.
*   Apply their understanding of the Coriolis acceleration to determine the direction of rotation of hurricanes.
