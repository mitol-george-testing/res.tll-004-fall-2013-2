Summary
-------

This video leads students through modeling the regular, non-linear pendulum with a differential equation. We explore why solutions to a differential equation are an infinite family of functions. We show that to determine a specific solution to this second order differential equation, two initial conditions must be specified. Proof of the need for two initial conditions is shown via use of the Taylor Series.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Understand that the physical laws governing a system’s properties can be modeled using differential equations.
*   Explain that the solution to a differential equation is a family of functions.
*   Recognize that specifying initial conditions determines a particular solution function to a differential equation.
