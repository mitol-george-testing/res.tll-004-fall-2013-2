Summary
-------

In this video, MIT chemistry professor Cathy Drennan briefly reviews the simplifications and assumptions of the VSEPR model. She walks students through a series of examples to help students translate 2D Lewis structures into 3D molecular geometries using the VSEPR model. Opportunities for pausing the video are provided so that students may construct 3D molecular models alongside the video.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Use the VSEPR model to predict 3D molecular structures from 2D Lewis structures.
*   Discuss some of the assumptions and limitations of the VSEPR model.
