Summary
-------

Prof. Ben Brubaker defines and explores the properties of the linear approximation of a function at a point. The linear approximation is then applied to solve a simple differential equation encountered in chemical kinetics.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Recognize the linear approximation of a function as the tangent line to the function.
*   Apply linear approximations to solve a simple differential equation.
*   Explain the limitations of linear approximations mathematically and graphically.
