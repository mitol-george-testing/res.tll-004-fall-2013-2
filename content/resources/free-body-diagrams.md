Summary
-------

This video consists of four sections: a brief refresher on the method for drawing free body diagrams, examples of free body diagrams with an opportunity to practice, examples of situations in which diagrams have been drawn incorrectly (and corrections for them), a final segment that draws connections between free body diagrams and the physical situations they describe.

Learning Objectives

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Identify errors in free body diagrams and correct them.
*   Recognize free body diagrams as representations of forces, and connect them with real world objects and phenomena.
