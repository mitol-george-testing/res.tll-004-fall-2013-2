Summary
-------

This video discusses negative and positive feedback loops, how they tie into the body’s mechanism of internal regulation, and what happens when these mechanisms fail. Thermoregulation, contractions during childbirth, and blood glucose regulation are used to illustrate how feedback loops pass information in the body to maintain homeostasis or elicit a particular biological response.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Identify the general components of a feedback loop.
*   Provide examples of negative and positive feedback loops in the body.
*   Describe how feedback loops are vital to healthy function and survival.
