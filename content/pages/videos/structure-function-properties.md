This is done to better understand how a buffer works and the components a buffer must contain in order to be effective. Students evaluate these models against a set of criteria determined at the beginning of the video and then consider other parameters that must be taken into account when designing a buffer. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Describe how the structure, or composition, of a buffer functions to resist changes in pH. Explain how the choices made in buffer design impact the properties of a buffer.

Students first analyze some everyday objects and determine if they are chiral or achiral. Students then extend this idea to small molecules and proteins. Mirror image proteins are discussed, specifically antifreeze proteins. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Identify chiral objects and molecules. Understand how chirality plays a role in the function of biological compounds.

They see how the chemical structure of the macromolecules used in the films affects the function and properties of the film. Students learn how these films have been used to regenerate bone tissue components in rats. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to explain how the concepts of pH and pKa are useful in the design of materials via layer-by-layer assembly.
