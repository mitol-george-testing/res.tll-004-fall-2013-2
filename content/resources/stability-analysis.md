Summary
-------

This video introduces students to the notion of stability of equilibria. A temperature example is explored using an energy argument, and then the typical linear stability analysis framework is introduced. This framework is applied in detail to analyze a pendulum.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be familiar with the framework of equilibrium and stability analysis.
