Summary
-------

This video presents students with a problem solving process that they might find useful in solving ill defined problems. Students see how this problem solving process was used by MIT graduate students to complete a class project.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Identify the steps of the problem solving process.
*   Recognize that the problem solving process is iterative.
