This is achieved by modeling each rigid gear body as a system of 3 equations, the input and output gears as one linear equation each, and then modeling the connection between gears as another linear equation derived from Newton’s second law. The resulting matrix is explored for consistency and design elements. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Model the forces and torques in a gear train as a system of linear equations. Combine these linear equations into a matrix equation.

The linear approximation is then applied to solve a simple differential equation encountered in chemical kinetics. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Recognize the linear approximation of a function as the tangent line to the function. Apply linear approximations to solve a simple differential equation. Explain the limitations of linear approximations mathematically and graphically.

Properties of time independent rotation matrices are explored. The problem of the wobbly disk is scaffolded through a sequence of increasingly more complicated motions. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Identify rotation matrices. Decompose the motion of the wobbly, thrown disk into translational and rotational components. Write the rotational motion of the disk as a product of rotation matrices.

A temperature example is explored using an energy argument, and then the typical linear stability analysis framework is introduced. This framework is applied in detail to analyze a pendulum. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be familiar with the framework of equilibrium and stability analysis.
