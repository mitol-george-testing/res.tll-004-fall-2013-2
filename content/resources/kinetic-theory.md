Summary
-------

This video encourages students to access their knowledge of kinetic theory and apply it to the real world problem of light bulb blackening. Students are also introduced to the concept of mean free path.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Discuss the physical significance of a gas molecule's mean free path.
*   Discuss the physical parameters that affect the mean free path.
