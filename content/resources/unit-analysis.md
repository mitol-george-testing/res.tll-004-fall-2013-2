Summary
-------

This video has 2 chapters. The first chapter determines the units of the differential quantity dx in terms of the units of x, and explores how integration and differentiation affect units. The second chapter works through a physics example computing the work of an applied force on an object. The effects of derivatives and integrals are used to check the units of the physical quantities involved at several steps along the way.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Utilize and apply the key properties of unit analysis: when two quantities are multiplied, their units also multiply, and all terms added, subtracted in an equation must have the same units.
*   Explain how derivatives and integrals affect units.
