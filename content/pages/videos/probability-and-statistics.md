Engineers, designers, and architects often use probability distributions to predict system behavior. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Image by Chris French.  {{< br >}}_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}{{< video-gallery-item href="/resources/conditional-probability" section="Probability and Statistics" title="Conditional Probability" description="Summary This video provides an introduction to conditional probability and its calculations. The first chapter reviews basic probability terminology and introduces standard conditional probability notation using a simple marble drawing example. The second chapter introduces the use of tree diagrams to help visualize the sample space and allow for more complex probability calculations. In the last chapter, we see how conditional probability can and must be used to make sense of medical diagnoses. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Calculate the conditional probability of a given event using tables and trees. Understand how conditional probability can be used to interpret medical diagnoses.

The concept of a random walk is connected to diffusion and is used to explain the structure of Ficks law. Finally, Ficks Law is used to explain why wearing a coat is useful in the winter, to estimate diffusion times for biomolecules, and to understand why we need a circulatory system to efficiently transport oxygen throughout the body. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Describe the difference between regular and random walks. Explain the structure of Ficks law.

The Chi square test for goodness of fit is used to analyze experimental data from a basic coin flipping experiment. Students then use what they learned to better understand experimental data obtained from genetic experiments. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to apply Chi square hypothesis testing to experimental data obtained from genetic experiments.

Students apply what they learned to examples of discrete and continuous distributions. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Explain moments of distributions. Compute moments and understand what they mean.
