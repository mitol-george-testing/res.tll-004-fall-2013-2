Summary
-------

This video consists of four chapters: an introduction to the concept of the vector, a brief review of vector properties, an exploration of vector properties using physical intuition based on displacements, and finally, a discussion of how to recognize when a physical quantity can be represented by a vector, which works through the example of force and the non-example of rotation.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this video, students will be able to:

*   Understand the properties of vectors by using displacement as an example
*   Determine whether a physical quantity can be represented using vectors
