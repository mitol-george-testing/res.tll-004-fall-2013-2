Summary
-------

This video leads students through describing the motion of all points on a wobbly disk as a function of time. Properties of time independent rotation matrices are explored. The problem of the wobbly disk is scaffolded through a sequence of increasingly more complicated motions.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Identify rotation matrices.
*   Decompose the motion of the wobbly, thrown disk into translational and rotational components.
*   Write the rotational motion of the disk as a product of rotation matrices.
