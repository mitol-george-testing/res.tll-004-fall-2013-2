Summary
-------

This video describes many facets of light, introducing it as a context in which to discuss scientific modeling. Students are asked to explain various phenomena in terms of which model describe them most effectively. The video also touches on wave-particle duality, through the double-slit experiment, and its application to both light and matter.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Explain the major models of light.
*   Explain the different facets of light in terms of those models.
*   Understand how models are used in science.
