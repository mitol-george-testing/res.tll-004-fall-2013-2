Summary
-------

This video provides an introduction to conditional probability and its calculations. The first chapter reviews basic probability terminology and introduces standard conditional probability notation using a simple marble drawing example. The second chapter introduces the use of tree diagrams to help visualize the sample space and allow for more complex probability calculations. In the last chapter, we see how conditional probability can and must be used to make sense of medical diagnoses.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Calculate the conditional probability of a given event using tables and trees.
*   Understand how conditional probability can be used to interpret medical diagnoses.
