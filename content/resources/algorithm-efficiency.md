Summary
-------

In this video, MIT professor of Computer Science and Engineering Charles Leiserson explains the importance of speed and space efficiency in programming. He guides students through different methods of computing the Fibonacci sequence and discusses the differences in efficiency of each version. Next, students are presented with several modern programming scenarios. Opportunities for pausing the video are provided so that students may independently consider and appreciate the different factors of efficiency in each example.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Identify common resource limitations when programming.
*   Understand speed and space and how they may be related.
*   Understand how efficiency affects modern problem solving.
