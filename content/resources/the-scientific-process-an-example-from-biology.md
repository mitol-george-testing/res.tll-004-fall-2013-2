Summary
-------

This video provides a brief, factual account of the groundbreaking work of Robin Warren and Barry Marshall and their discovery of the bacterial cause of peptic ulcer disease. Their story is a concrete example of the "Scientific Process" in practice. It illustrates that although the scientific method is often presented as a didactic list of steps, there is no one fixed sequence of events that occurs in order for important scientific discoveries to be made.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Describe the general steps of the scientific method.
*   Recognize the complex and multi-faceted nature of the scientific process.
*   Explain how the discovery of _Helicobacter pylori_ and its connection to peptic ulcer disease exemplifies key aspects of the scientific process.
