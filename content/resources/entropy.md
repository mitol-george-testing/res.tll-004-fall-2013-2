Summary
-------

This video begins with observations of spontaneous processes from daily life and then connects the idea of spontaneity to entropy. Entropy is described as a measure of the number of possible ways energy can be distributed in a system of molecules. Students apply this description to understand the entropy change in a heat diffusion experiment.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Describe, at a basic level, the concept of a microstate.
*   Discuss what entropy measures in a conceptual way.
