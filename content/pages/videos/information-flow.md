A system is shaped and changed by the nature and flow of information into, within, and out of the system. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Image by Krista Shapton for Vecna Cares, and Chris French.  {{< br >}}_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}{{< video-gallery-item href="/resources/feedback-loops" section="Information Flow" title="Feedback Loops" description="Summary This video discusses negative and positive feedback loops, how they tie into the body’s mechanism of internal regulation, and what happens when these mechanisms fail. Thermoregulation, contractions during childbirth, and blood glucose regulation are used to illustrate how feedback loops pass information in the body to maintain homeostasis or elicit a particular biological response. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Identify the general components of a feedback loop. Provide examples of negative and positive feedback loops in the body. Describe how feedback loops are vital to healthy function and survival.

He guides students through different methods of computing the Fibonacci sequence and discusses the differences in efficiency of each version. Next, students are presented with several modern programming scenarios. Opportunities for pausing the video are provided so that students may independently consider and appreciate the different factors of efficiency in each example. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Identify common resource limitations when programming. Understand speed and space and how they may be related. Understand how efficiency affects modern problem solving.

Students see how the components in the regenerative receiver circuit work together to dampen unwanted frequencies, while selectively amplifying and demodulating a desired AM signal. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to explain how a basic radio receiver circuit functions to select particular radio frequencies.
